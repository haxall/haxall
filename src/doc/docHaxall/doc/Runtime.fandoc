Overview [#overview]
********************
All system components are packaged into a single top-level object called
the *runtime*.  The runtime is accessed via the `hx::HxRuntime` API.  It
is possible to run multiple runtimes within a single JVM.

Daemon [#daemon]
****************
The *Haxall daemon* is the default implementation of the runtime.  A daemon
is created via the 'hx init' command, and executed via 'hx run'.  These
commands are covered in the `Setup` chapter.

You can customize the bootstrap of a deamon using the Fantom class 'hxd::HxdBoot'.
Here is an example to illustrate using custom config and required libs:

  boot := HxdBoot
  {
    it.dir = myDatabaseDir
    it.config["serialSpi"] = "myPod::SerialSpiImpl"
    it.requiredLibs.add("myCustomLib")
  }
  boot.run

Default behavior of the the daemon:
  - creates an instance of HxFolio for the database
  - simple user manager which stores users in the runtime database
  - HTTP API with all the standard ops
  - simple Axon shell as the UI
  - provides basic in-memory historian using circular buffers

SkySpark [#skyspark]
********************
SkySpark is multi-tenant and supports multiple project runtimes.  SkySpark
implements one runtime for the host via `skyarcd::Sys.rt`.  Each project is
also a full runtime via `skyarcd::Proj.rt`.

SkySpark runs some low-level libs at the host level as *SysMods*.  For
example, there is only one instance of the 'http', 'api', and 'user' libs (shared
by all projects as SysMods).  Then each run project runs its own instance
of *Exts* which includes libs like 'point', 'task', 'conn', etc.  The Haxall
documentation will often use the term library/lib and extension/ext
interchangeability for this reason.

Lifecycle [#lifecycle]
**********************
The runtime lifecycle defines a multi-stage series of phases for startup
and shutdown.  Startup phases are:

  1. Instantiation: libs are created, but only basic info is available
  2. Start: libs can lookup services and other libs, kick off background processing
  3. Ready: all libs have completed their onStart callback, HTTP port is opened
  4. Steady state: delay after ready to given apps and connectors time to spin up

The shutdown phases are:
  1. Unready: shutdown external ports
  2. Stop: cease all background processing

Shutdown happens automatically when the runtime process is killed via
`sys::Env.addShutdownHook`.

See the [lib chapter]`Libs#lifecycle` for how these phases map to the
`hx::HxLib` callbacks.

Steady State [#steadyState]
***************************
Steady state is a configurable delay after bootstrap used to give the
system time to reach equilibrium.  This gives internal services time to
spin up before interacting with external systems. By default the steady
state delay is 10sec.  It may be tuned by applying the `steadyState` tag
to the `projMeta` record.

The configured delay starts after the database is loaded and all libraries
have completed their [onStart]`hx::HxLib.onStart` and [onReady]`hx::HxLib.onReady`
callbacks.  Once the delay expires, the [steady state]`isSteadyState()`
flag transitions to true and libraries receive the [onSteadyState]`hx::HxLib.onSteadyState`
callback.

Activities which occur *before* steady state:
  - Applications which require current point values should initialize their
    watches
  - Connectors should begin polling/subscribing to watched points to ensure
    data is up-to-date once steady state is reached

Activities which occur *after* steady state:
  - Tasks do not subscribe to their observables until steady state (including
    scheduled tasks)
  - Local history collection is suppressed until steady state
  - Connector writes are suppressed until steady state, then the current
    write level of all writable points is broadcast to connectors which
    may issue a remote write if the `writeOnStart` tuning policy is configured
  - Rule engine (SkySpark only) does not begin to compute rules until after
    steady state
