// Point with writable output using 16-level priority array.  Writable
// points typically are a setpoint or actuator command.  Haystack writable
// points are modeled on the BACnet 16-level priority array with a
// relinquish default which effectively acts as level 17.
//
// The following levels have special behavior:
//  - **Level 1**: highest priority reserved for emergency overrides
//  - **Level 8**: manual override with ability to set timer to expire back to auto
//  - **Default**: implicitly acts as level 17 for relinquish default
//
// The priority array provides for contention resolution when many different
// control applications may be vying for control of a given point. Low level
// applications like scheduling typically control levels 14, 15, or 16. Then
// users can override at level 8. But a higher levels like 2 to 7 can be used
// to trump a user override (for example a demand response energy routine
// that requires higher priority).
//
// The actual value to write is resolved by starting at level 1 and working down
// to relinquish default to find the first non-null value. It is possible for
// all levels to be null, in which case the overall write output is null (which
// in turn may be auto/null to another system). Anytime a null value is written
// to a priority level, we say that level has been set to auto or released (this
// allows the next highest level to take command of the output).
